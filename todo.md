Define the language syntax: Before starting to write any code, you need to define the syntax of your programming language. This includes specifying the types of statements and expressions that the language supports, as well as the grammar rules that define their structure.

Write the lexer: The lexer is responsible for converting the source code into a stream of tokens that the parser can understand. You should write a lexer that can tokenize the statements and expressions defined in your language's syntax.

Write the parser: The parser is responsible for converting the token stream produced by the lexer into an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the structure of the program. You should write a parser that can recognize the grammar rules defined in your language's syntax and generate the corresponding AST.

Write the interpreter: The interpreter is responsible for executing the program represented by the AST generated by the parser. You should write an interpreter that can traverse the AST and execute the statements and expressions in the correct order.

Write tests: You should write automated tests to verify that your lexer, parser, and interpreter are working correctly. These tests should cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure that your interpreter is robust.

Write documentation: You should write documentation that explains how to use your interpreter, including how to write programs in your programming language, how to execute them using the interpreter, and any other relevant information.
